### 4. Coolest

##### 4.1 Embedded images

* I can easily give the path to an image and it just works
* How dope is that?

##### 4.2 Embedded html

* If I want, I can just shove HTML right into the middle of it like I don't give a damn
* I mean this just turns into HTML eventually anyway so who cares right? I can just force this to do whatever I want. Awesome.
